Car Dekho - Used Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’°

Overview:
This project leverages machine learning to predict used car prices, enhancing customer experience and improving pricing accuracy. By utilizing historical car data, the model estimates car prices based on factors such as make, model, year, fuel type, and transmission. The final model is deployed through an interactive Streamlit application, allowing real-time price predictions.
